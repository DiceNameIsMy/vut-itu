# 1. The Application (Zadání)
### 1.1 Name & Topic (Název a téma)
#### 1.1.1 YouQuest
We have decided we'd like to look into applications that provide tooling to help people in planning their upcoming trips, be it one or many cities, a new country, or a different continent. Nadzeya came up with this idea because of the many issues she and her friends had with the tooling they were recently using. Some of them being:

#### 1.1.2 Team members
- Albert Popov (xpopov10)
- Nadzeya Antsipenka (xantsi00) <- Captain
- Nurdaulet Turar (xturarn00)

---
### 1.2 Customers research (Uživatelský průzkum a specifikace)
We have found and interviewed relevant 5 customers in total. An offline interview, open-ended Q&A, and an online questionnare were used. Here's what we've learned from them:
#### 1.2.1 Our customers (kdo je konkrétní uživatel)
- People interested in traveling.
- Primarily people who own, or are used to renting a car when traveling.
#### 1.2.2 What they want/need from the application (co přesně od aplikace potřebuje)
- A tool that makes planning of a trip easy.
#### 1.2.3 Customer Requirements (poždavky uživatele)
A summary:
- A streamlined, intuitive interface with minimal clutter.
- Ability to browse attractions with user recommendations on routes, not just destinations. TODO: What does that mean?
- **Recommendations** not only on places to visit, but **on whole routes with attractions to take**.
- Be able to find and research places. With pictures. When they are found and selected, **suggest possible routes to take.**
- Shared accounts for group planning.
- Weather forecasts for planned dates and destinations.
- Storage for travel-related documents (tickets, QR codes, location details).
#### 1.2.4 Underlying Research

##### 1.2.4.1 Albert's customer research:
- Created a Google Form (https://forms.gle/QXqrSPgtp4VPS8CR9)
- Surveyed 2 respondents

1. **Have you travelled or are you planning to travel? Or has someone planned it for you?**
- Yes
- Yes, I have travelled

2. **How did you plan it? How did you choose the places, cities to visit? What criteria did you use to choose?**
- Proximity to each member of the expedition, relatively cheap accommodation and flights.
- Internet guides. Hashtags on Instagram. Reviews on Google maps

3. **Do you use apps when planning your trip, if so, which ones?**
- No
- Help notes on mobile

4. **What was your experience? What did you like about it? What could have been done better? (if you haven't used the app, you can skip it)**
- I like the ease of use. Easy to change the schedule. Ease of sharing notes.
- (Not using any apps)

5. **Do you factor in events (fairs, carnivals, festivals) in the places you visit?**
- No
- Yes

6. **Do you go for the sights of a city or for the events in that city?**
- The first option
- Both sights and events

7. **What is your usual budget? Floating or specific?**
- I usually don't have a segmented amount and i often spend more than expected
- Floating

8. **When you visit a city, are you interested in seeing the sights around that city? (Out of town)**
- Yes, thats why i love traveling by car
- Yes, as long as it is easily accessible by public transportation.

9. **Do you prefer to visit only one city or several cities?**
- I prefer to visit several cities and even several countries within my trip
- Depends on the number of days and the size of the city. 3 days for a small city (Znojmo), 10 days for a big city (Paris).

10. **When traveling from one city to another, would you like to see sights along the way?**
- Yes
- Rather no than yes. Only if a private car

11. **Are there any wishes for the apps you use?**
- Easy to use, so that I wouldn't be too lazy to use it after a couple of uses
- No

12. **What do you miss when planning your travels? What would help you with that?**
- Maybe it would be great to have an app where i can store all QR codes, PINs, addresses, and telephone numbers related to this trip (flights, accommodation etc).
- Automatic weather updates. For example, two days before departure/leave get an alert: “It will rain in $city_name for the next two days. Don't forget to take an umbrella” etc.

Survey Conclusion

    Trip Planning: Both respondents had travelled before and planned their trips themselves. They chose destinations based on accessibility, accommodation and transport costs, as well as online reviews and social media such as Instagram and Google Maps.

    Use of apps: Both respondents indicated that they do not use specialised planning apps, relying on notes on mobile devices. They appreciate the ease and convenience of editing schedules and sharing notes.

    Travel interests: One respondent prefers to visit attractions, while the other is interested in both attractions and events such as fairs and festivals.

    Budget: Learners indicated that their budget is usually ‘floating’ and they often spend more than they had planned. This indicates a flexible approach to finances.

Thus, it can be concluded that users are interested in an app that would integrate route planning, trip information storage and weather alerts to facilitate trip organisation and improve travel comfort.

##### 1.2.4.2 Nadzeya's customer research:
- Developed a list of questions for in-person respondent interviews.
- Surveyed 2 respondents.

To summarize, our potential customers want a travel app to have:
- a basic interface initially that grows in complexity only as needed.
- a clean, minimalistic design with color accents for important menu items.
- an easy-to-create wish list of destinations marked on a map without requiring daily or hourly scheduling.
- automatic distance calculation between wish-listed spots, with suggestions for nearby attractions.
- minor, lesser-known locations (e.g., cemeteries, small landmarks, abandoned buildings) with photos and descriptions, even if these places aren't typically classified as "mainstream" attractions.
- a simple list of local, free events without cluttering the primary experience.
- filters or tags to prioritize affordable food, accommodation, and travel options.
- user-provided guides about places to eat, stay, visit, and other minor areas of interest.
##### 1.2.4.3 Nurdaulet's customer research
- Developed a list of questions for in-person respondent interviews.
- Using that, has interviewed 1 relevant customer.

My interviewee does not have extensive experience with other trip-planning apps. I conducted an interview to learn more about his travel experiences, focusing on why he enjoys traveling, how he approaches trip planning, and how some of his past trips have went.

He is open to exploring new apps to find a better fit for his needs. Specifically, he would like an app that can assist with trip planning while suggesting activities and places to visit. A key use case he mentioned is when driving to a new city - using a navigation app to display interesting attractions and sightseeing opportunities along the route.

I aimed to find spots in his process, that we could optimize to improve his experience. To learn about that, I've started by asking open-ended questions, but then went more directly. Below is a summary of the most relevant questions and responses:
1. Have you ever planned a trip to a completely new location? (It would make no sense to continue if an answer was a no)
    - Yes
2. How did you plan it? How did you choose places or cities to visit? What were your selection criteria?
    - My mother wanted to travel, so we searched on Google and used 34Travel along with friends’ recommendations. The main criteria were sightseeing opportunities, financial accessibility, and if possible, a location within the EU for visa purposes.
3. What applications did you use during the planning process?
    - Beach spots: photos and reviews on the web
    - Other attractions: reviews and articles on the web (reviews are more relevant than articles)
4. How was your experience? What did you enjoy, and what could be improved?
    - It would be convenient to have a tool for simultaneously planning places to visit (find & browse attractions, decide on whether they are interesting see reviews, photos, etc.) and organizing a route (decide on how to visit places chosen, see if all works out timetable).
5. Do you consider events happening at your travel destinations?
    -  No
6. Are you interested in seeing nearby attractions?
    -  Yes
7. While traveling from one location to another (they use carsharing), do you explore places, attractions along the way?
    -  Yes

#### 1.3.7 Conclusion
None of the applications fulfill all the main wishes of our respondents we've identified. Some excel at their own thing (TripAdvisor, TripIt), some tried to include everything on one place but failed to consider what's the most important for users (Wanderlog). //TODO: Add smth about Sygic & MakeMyTrip?

Keypoints:
- It's very important to keep in mind our customer's first interaction when designing a multi-purpose, all-around app, because the first impression is the biggest factor in user retention.
- //TODO: Add something about none of the apps providing routes from real users, or them being badly implemented. We can to better.
- //TODO: ...
- Driving in a car can get boring. They wanted like to have a way to discover & visit nearby attractions while on their way to their main destination.
- //TODO Написать о том что мы при планировании поездок мы используем множетсво ресурсов в рамках одного приложения
- //TODO 
### 1.4 App Requirements (Zadání)

#### 1.4.1 User Capabilities

### 2.2 Tech stack choice (Výběr technologií)
The following sections detail our choices for the platform and framework, along with the reasoning behind each decision.
#### 2.2.1 Chosen FE Platform
We have decided to make a mobile application. Our users are always carrying their phones with them (everyone do). Since we provide **offline navigation**, storing of tickets, passes, mobile platform fits best for our use case.
#### 2.2.2 Chosen FE Framework
We have chosen Flutter as out mobile framework, since it is the best fit for our application. When considering the choice of technology stack, we've been considering **Time To Market**, being how fast an application can be built & released, **performance**, since displaying a customized map is a moderatly intensive task. **We did not care about the application size**, since it's safe to say that these days most phones can easily allocate ~100 MB of storage. Here's a table of comparison:

| Platform         | Development Time                                              | Team Experience                             | Performance             | Application Size |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------- |
| **Native**       | Longest development time                                      | No experience with native development       | Highest performance     | Minimal          |
| **React Native** | Shorter time to market                                        | Limited prior experience                    | Below average           | Relatively small |
| **Xamarin**      | Moderate time to market; may need platform-specific expertise | Strong in C# and .NET                       | Average                 | Moderate         |
| **Flutter**      | Shorter time to market                                        | Dart is similar to C#; solid OOP background | Near-native performance | Relatively large |

#### 2.2.3 Chosen BE Framework

We've chosen .NET to develop an API for our application. Reasoning behind this:
- We all have experience with .NET Framework -> it's the fastest way for us to create a BE.
- It's both performant in development time and execution time.
- Huge and very mature developers community.

### 2.3 BE API (Návrh API k BE, v rámci týmu)

#### 2.3.1 Architecture: MVVM at FE

![FE Architecture](Pasted%20image%2020241107230844.png)

#### 2.3.2 Data model
Below our current sketch of our data model is presented. Cities are added when a place inside that city is added. User can plan to visit several places within one city.

![Data Model](Pasted%20image%2020241107231140.png)

#### 2.3.3 Backend
Most of the functionality is going to be provided via http API.

Our API will provide the following:
- 🌍 Querying of **Points of Interest (PoI)** within some location range. It can be a city, a town, a museum, a mall, or whatever else.
- 🌄 Querying of Trips for inspiration. If user likes something, provide an action to copy it to his list of trips. 
	- On BE, a recommendation system would be added (out of scope, won't implement). It would pick out trip ideas from a database of trips of other users, that would then be shown to users that are looking for some inspiration.
- 🏛️ Adding a **Place** he wants to visit which is linked to a **PoI**.
- ☁️ Get a weather forecast for the **Cities** or **Places** he wants to visit for the dates range. It can be within his planned visiting dates, or a wider range to pick better dates.
- ✈️ CRUD of his **Trips**, an entity that holds the places he wants to visit during the trip.
- 🏛️ CRUD of his places.
- 📄 CRUD of his **Documents**, files that are useful to have in hand during the trip.
- ⭐ Create a review for a **Place** he had visited.
During development, more actions may be added as we spot what we might've missed.
